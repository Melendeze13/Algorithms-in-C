# Pseudo Algorithms to C

## Source: Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition

To help me learn and understand algorithms I will be implementing them from
pseudo code to C. I will be doing this as supplemental material for my
algorithms class.

### Goals

* Implement search, sort, and special algorithms
* Create a benchmark suite to comepare algorithm runtimes
